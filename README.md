## Collatz Conjecture

This program needs to be run in python. python collatz.py

The obect of this exercise is to write a program to show the steps in the collatz conjecture for any input number.

Collatz Conjecture starts with any positive integer n. 
If n is an even number, the next term is n divided by 2. 
If n is an odd number the next term is 3 times n plus 1. 
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
