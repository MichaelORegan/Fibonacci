## Fibonacci Number


My name is Michael, so the first and last letter of my name (M + L = 13 +12 = 25), the 25th number of the fibonacci sequence is 75,025


## Fibonacci Name

My surname is O'Regan The first letter O is number 79 The last letter n is number 110 Fibonacci number 189 is 1409869790947669143312035591975596518914

Ord() gives a character a counting numerical value, as per ascii O is 79 and n is 110

It took me a while to figure it out as I could not figure why they were not sequential numbers

This is shown best when I keep all letters in my surname in lower case as they become in sequence as in n then o as in the alphabet
