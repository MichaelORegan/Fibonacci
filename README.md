# Exercise 1 (fib.py)
## Fibonacci Number

This algorithim run in python code will return the nth fibonacci number.
 

# Exercise 2 (fib.py)
## Fibonacci Name

This algorithim run in python code will return the nth fibonacci number.  The nth fibonacci number based on the first and last letter of your name and adding their relative position on the ASCII table together to get a number.


# Exercise 3 (collatz.py)
## Collatz Conjecture

This program needs to be run in python. python collatz.py

The obect of this exercise is to write a program to show the steps in the collatz conjecture for any input number.

Collatz Conjecture starts with any positive integer n. 
If n is an even number, the next term is n divided by 2. 
If n is an odd number the next term is 3 times n plus 1. 
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.


# Exercise 4 (euler5.py)
## Project Euler Problem number 5

Problem number 5 : 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

This problem number 5 wants us to get the lowest common multiple of the numbers between 1 and 20.

I had trouble with this one and I was not able to get it at all.  I am still not happy that I did not figure it out for myself and will continue to try this one.

It was only when we did the gcd in a lecture that I could think I might be able to do it as the lcm and gcd are related.

Using python I get the gcd and use that to get the lcm. 


# Exercise 5 (Irisdataset.py)
## Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in

Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.

This script using Python will take the numbers from a csv file and format them as above.  


# Exercise 6 (factorial.py)
## Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() 

Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.

Using Python this script will give the factorial of the specified nuymbers.  After watching the video of sumall I ammended the function to multiply instead of adding.
