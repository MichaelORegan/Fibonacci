# Exercise 1 (fib.py)
## Fibonacci Number

This algorithim run in python code will return the nth fibonacci number.
 

# Exercise 2 (fib.py)
## Fibonacci Name

This algorithim run in python code will return the nth fibonacci number.  The nth fibonacci number based on the first and last letter of your name and adding their relative position on the ASCII table together to get a numebr.


# Exercise 3 (collatz.py)
## Collatz Conjecture

This program needs to be run in python. python collatz.py

The obect of this exercise is to write a program to show the steps in the collatz conjecture for any input number.

Collatz Conjecture starts with any positive integer n. 
If n is an even number, the next term is n divided by 2. 
If n is an odd number the next term is 3 times n plus 1. 
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.


# Exercise 4 (euler5.py
## Project Euler Problem number 5

Problem number 5 : 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


# Exercise 5 (Irisdataset.py)
## Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.


# Exercise 6 
## Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.

After watching the video of sumall I ammended the function to multiply instead of adding.
